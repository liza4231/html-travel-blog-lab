        This was my first trip to Fire Island and as such I wanted to get some of the history of the Island so I started off with a tour of the lighthouse. 
        There, I learned that that the lighthouse was built in 1858 from the recycled material from the original lighthouse half a mile west.

        Then I went on a hike in the Sunken Forest. Unfortunately since this trip was in mid-August there was mosquitos everywhere but it was still a pleasant experience.

        After the hike it was time for my favorite part, the beach! I spent the majority of my day walking by the shore and jumping in the water for a swim.
